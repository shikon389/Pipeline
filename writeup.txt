Assignment 5 - Pipelining

	After our program takes in the users input, it parsers it into an
array of structs. Said struct, stores each command and it's corsponding
arguments/flags into a seperate array. After our database is complete, we 
set up a number of pipelines based on the ammount of commands the user wishes to
execute. Depending on what number command is being executed, we have a
seperate method for the first command, in between commands and the final
command. Every time a new command needs to be executed, we fork a new process,
create a new pipline with dup2 and then use execvp to execute the new request.

	We tested our program under the following conditions:

1. A single command with no arguments.
2. A single command with one arguments.
3. A single command with multiple arguments.
4. Two commands with no arguments.
5. Two commands with a signle argument.
6. Two commands with multiple arguments.
7. Three or more commands with no arguments.
8. Three or more commands with a signle argument.
9. Three or more commands with multiple arguments.

All tests with multiple arguments had a combination of arguments with single
quotes, double quotes and no quotes, to test if our parser worked properly.
